The questions we are focused on relate to, fatal pathogens by age group and location, as well as common symptoms caused by pathogens in terms of helping with pathogen identification, and common symptoms caused by pathogens by age group. We hope that by answering these questions with the data we have, users will be able to better understand how they can actively work to reduce the extremity of these pathogens. This app will allow users to easily pick and choose what they would like to include in their analysis and allows them to visualize the findings. Our target audience consists mainly of health professionals who may be interested in understanding the underlying causes of deaths occurring globally and what measures they can take/improve upon to prevent these infections from spreading.
