## ðŸ’Š **Pathogen-Analysis-App**

The data used in this app comes from multiple sources around the globe that was then consolidated by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. In addition to providing information related to the death rate of 33 fatal pathogens, this app allows users to filter information by bacterial infections related to locations around the world and age groups. 

These tools will hopefully serve as a resource that provides healthcare professionals such as epidemiologists and clinicians with the data they need to understand which pathogens and bacterial symptoms they need to target in order to reduce the number of deaths caused by certain fatal pathogens.
